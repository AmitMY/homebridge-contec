## Support
In the current state, the plugin supports the following devices:

- Taps
- Boilers

And allows split support for several homebridge bridges in case you have more than a 100 devices.
Recommended split:
- Instance 1: `["Lamp"]`
- Instance 2: `["Blinds", "Air conditioner", "Tap", "Boiler"]`

## Usage
Currently, it is hard coded to find the contec client on `http://10.0.0.100/content/`, but if necessary to configure please open a relevant issue.

1. Use any linux/mac (recommended: Raspberry Pi) and run the homebridge client.
2. Install this plugin by doing `sudo npm install -g homebridge-contec@latest`
3. Add the platform to the config

### Sample config:
```json
